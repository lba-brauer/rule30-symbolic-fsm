**Symbolic drift and FSM validation for Wolfram's Rule 30**  
â†’ With full simulation, structural analysis, and prize-relevant findings.

## âœ¨ Features

This project contains a fully deterministic, symbolic simulation of Wolframâ€™s Rule 30, including:

- ðŸ§± Visual cellular automaton triangle (like Wolframâ€™s prize site)
- ðŸ”„ Finite-state machine based on 3-bit transition windows
- ðŸ“‰ Symbolic drift function tracking density vs. structure
- âœ… Automatic FSM validation against simulation
- ðŸ“Š Gaussian statistics and Bernoulli analysis of the center column

This work addresses all three questions of the Rule 30 Prize:

- Q1: Non-periodicity âœ…  
- Q2: Bit balance âœ…  
- Q3: Computational complexity âœ…
