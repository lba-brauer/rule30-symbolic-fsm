# rule30-symbolic-fsm
Symbolic drift and FSM validation for Wolfram's Rule 30 â€“ with full simulation, analysis, and prize-relevant findings.

This project contains a fully deterministic, symbolic simulation of Wolframâ€™s Rule 30, along with:

- A visual cellular automaton triangle (like Wolframâ€™s prize site)
- A finite-state machine based on 3-bit transition windows
- A symbolic drift function tracking density vs. structure
- Full automatic FSM validation against simulation
- Gaussian statistics and Bernoulli analysis of the center column
